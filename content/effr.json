The formation of the Republic united the Timocracy of Faulia, the Federal Republic of Evaria and its continuation The Free State of Nova Faulia (Okra) in a single federation.\r\n\r\nWhile Faulia has been under Evarian occupation between 2832 and 3014, and after that Faulian forces were present in Nyfauleg, the EFFR is the first peacefully created nation where humans and humanoids live together.\r\n\r\n## Names\r\n\r\n| Language | Name                                   |\r\n|----------|----------------------------------------|\r\n| English  | Evarian-Faulian Federative Republic    |\r\n| Faulian  | Ewamg\u00e1 o F\u00e1lykoss\u00e1 an Federativana Resp\u00fablika |\r\n| Armosian | Evamya a Folya ane Federativanye Respoblik |\r\n| Tyrian   | Evagar og Faulgar Federativa Respublik  |\r\n| Norsian  | Ev\u00e6gs og Faulges Federative Respublik   |\r\n| Polish   | Republika Federalna Ewaski a Foliski   |\r\n| Dutch    | Federale Republiek van Evari\u00eb en Fauli\u00eb |",
